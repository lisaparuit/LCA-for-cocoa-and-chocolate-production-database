# LCA of Chocolate production database

The project was lead durring a 2 months internship with Dr Laura Armengot Martinez at the Agroecology department in the university of Barcelona. 

The project was a meta-analysis of sustainable cocoa production worldwide. My contributions were to find and work on data from
the litterature to make it suitable for analysis, which I was able to partially perform. I also worked on the build up of a database to collect and store the data in an accessible way. This repository contains my actvity report as well as the associated files.

Thanks for reading!
